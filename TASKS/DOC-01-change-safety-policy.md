# Task DOC-01: Change-Safety Policy for Planning and Audit Requests

**Target File:** `CONTRIBUTING.md`

**Issue:** Planning/audit-only requests need explicit no-touch documentation so agents do not edit files without clear user confirmation.

**Definition of Done:**
1. Add a policy section that states: planning/audit-only requests must not create/edit/delete files.
2. Add a policy line requiring explicit user confirmation before switching to edit mode in the same session.
3. Keep wording aligned with existing confirmation policy language in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
4. Verify the new section is visible and unambiguous in rendered markdown.

**Anchor Verification:** Review `CONTRIBUTING.md` and confirm both policy statements exist verbatim or equivalent.
